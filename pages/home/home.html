  <h2>Welcome to Ionic!</h2>
  <p>
    This starter project normally comes with a simple tabs-based layout for apps
    that are going to primarily use a Tabbed UI, but I've made a few oopsies that you have to sort out.
  </p>
  <p>
    Take a look at the tabs page to add more tabs to your UI, but first... why are there no tabs showing at the bottom...? hmmmm 
  </p>
    <strong>HINT:</strong> <em>check out the only class property present in app.component.ts, what page does it point to? </em>
